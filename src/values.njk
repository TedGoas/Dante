    <h2>Remote Work & Collaboration</h2>
    <p>I work best in remote environments. Since 2016 I've been remote, and since 2023 I've managed distributed teams. I helped shape Dialpad's remote culture and care about building processes that make collaboration smooth and human. I love getting together for milestones and celebrations, but I don't think we need to sit in an office every week—or even every month.</p>
    
    <h2>What I Work On</h2>
    <p>I don't need greenfield projects or flashy features to stay motivated. If what matters most to customers is billing, permissions, or some other unglamorous system, I'm happy to work on it. I also care about designing for people who are often overlooked, not just the latest "hot" product in tech.</p>
    
    <h2>Boundaries</h2>
    <p>I won't spend my energy on things I consider unethical—proof-of-work crypto, online gambling, or autonomous weapons, to name a few. I want to build things I can believe in.</p>
    
    <h2>Curiosity & AI</h2>
    <p>I'm fascinated by AI—both as a design tool and as a broader shift in how we work and live. I'm especially interested in making it approachable and understandable to everyone, not just experts.</p>
    
    <h2>Management Style</h2>
    <p>I think managers should stay close to the work. Even in leadership roles, I take on small, non-blocking projects and tinker with side experiments. When the stakes are high, I'll step in more actively, but my job is to coach and support my team—not to take the wheel away from them.</p>
    
    <h2>Generalist Approach</h2>
    <p>I'm a generalist at heart. I believe systems are designed better when you understand how they work end to end—from strategy to execution to the little details.</p>
    
    <h2>Leading with Care</h2>
    <p>I try to lead with care: sharing lessons I've learned the hard way, coaching, mentoring, and advocating for others. Paying it forward matters to me.</p>
    
    <h2>Handling Ambiguity</h2>
    <p>I'm comfortable in messy, complex situations. Real-world problems rarely come with clean answers, and I don't get too attached to any one idea—especially my own. If new information points to a better path, I'll take it.</p>
    
    <h2>Curiosity & Possibility</h2>
    <p>I like to start with "What could be?" Sometimes the familiar way is fine, but often it's worth questioning the defaults. Just because something is doesn't mean that's how it should be.</p>
    
    <h2>Communication</h2>
    <p>I value thoughtful communication. Writing comes first, but I'll often use video or voice messages instead of a long Slack thread or unnecessary meeting. Storytelling matters when making a case.</p>
    
    <h2>Learning New Domains</h2>
    <p>I pick up new industries quickly, which lets me bring fresh perspective without dismissing domain expertise.</p>
    
    <h2>Empowering Teams</h2>
    <p>I want my team to own their decisions. Most strategy and design choices should come from them, with me supporting, coaching, and unblocking as needed.</p>
    
    <h2>Balance & Intensity</h2>
    <p>I care about my time and my team's time. I'm always looking for smarter ways of working, especially with distributed teams and AI. I'll push my team to show up with focus and intensity, and I'll push just as hard for them to log off, recharge, and live full lives outside of work.</p>
