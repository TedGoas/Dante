  <p>You want to know if I can do the work, right? I get it. No long case studies here, I’ll save those for the interview. This page is just to show I’m worth a conversation, because I’ve been in your seat too and know what it’s like to waste time on the wrong fit.</p>
  <p>What's my design process? This is where you'd expect to see a diagram like this, right?</p>

  <h2>Dialpad (Designer Accomplishments)</h2>
  <p>I joined Dialpad because I believe customer support teams deserve better tools. These teams do unglamorous work, are always asked to do more with less, and are usually stuck with outdated software. I wanted to help build products that make their jobs easier and their work more valued.</p>
  <p>At Dialpad, I started as the first designer on the company’s support product and quickly grew into a leadership IC role. I’ve led several 0→1 initiatives, guided product integrations after three acquisitions, and now manage a team of eight designers. Together, we’re reimagining customer support with AI workflows that meaningfully improve the lives of agents and supervisors.</p>

    <p>Some highlights: helping grow the support product from $0 to $200M ARR, shaping a design team that scaled alongside that growth, and delivering measurable results in the product. For example, our chatbot now deflects 62% of incoming requests—beating the industry’s leading benchmark of 59%.</p>

  <h2>Stack Overflow</h2>
  <p>I joined Stack Overflow because I was excited about the power of knowledge-sharing at scale. Their consumer product had already become the go-to resource for developers, and I wanted to help bring that same value to companies building their own internal communities.</p>
  <p>As the first designer on Stack Overflow’s enterprise product, I wore a lot of hats: conducting user research, designing interfaces, and even writing production code. I focused heavily on admin tools that gave companies the ability to manage their communities and measure ROI, while also contributing to Stack’s design system.</p>

    <p>I helped grow the enterprise product from a single customer to over 30, laying the groundwork for its future success. I also built one of the first email design systems in the industry, which became a core part of how Stack Overflow communicated with users at scale.</p>

  <h2>Canfield Scientific</h2>
  <p>I joined Canfield Scientific because I was drawn to the opportunity to design technology that directly supports healthcare and clinical research. The company was known for its advanced imaging hardware, and I wanted to help bring the same level of quality and usability to the software side.</p>
  <p>As Canfield’s first software designer, I split my time between designing tools for clinical trials in an agency model and building software for the company’s own products. I worked directly with the CEO, President, and engineers, contributing across the entire stack of design needs—from logos and marketing sites to mobile UIs and HTML emails.</p>

    <p>During my time there, I established the foundation for Canfield’s design practice and helped shape how software supported both the company’s hardware products and its clients’ research efforts. It was a chance to be a true generalist, building design into the DNA of the company from the ground up.</p>
