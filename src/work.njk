    <h1>Work</h1>
    <p>You want to know if I can do the work right? Why spend the time contacting me if I can't walk the walk. I get it. You won't find any lengthy case studies here, I'll save those for the interview (if you REALLY want to see some, I have short ones here and here.) This page is to show you that I'm worth talking to, that I can do the work and am worth a conversation. Beyond that, I don't want to waste your time. Because I've been in your seat too and know what it's like.</p>
