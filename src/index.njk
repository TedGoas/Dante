      I lead teams that turn abstract ideas into usable products. I believe design is about taking the complex and chaotic and making it accessible, responsive, and as fast as possible.

      My goal is to create work that’s cool enough to show my friends and honest enough to show my parents.

      I’m currently a principal product designer and design manager at <a href="https://www.dialpad.com/">Dialpad</a>, where I lead the team responsible for our Support product. Before that I was a principal product designer at <a href="https://stackoverflow.com">Stack Overflow</a>, where I was the first designer for the enterprise product and built one of the first <a href="https://stackoverflow.design/email">email design systems</a>. Before that I was the founding designer at <a href="https://canfield.com">Canfield Scientific</a>, where I created software for running clinical trials. I also created and sold <a href="https://www.cerberusemail.com/">Cerberus</a>, an open source framework for email development.

      When not in front of a screen, I like to exercise, snowboard, watch and play hockey and soccer, work on my house, read, and explore New Jersey with my wife and kids.
